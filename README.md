# Self-Learning Document on Git Project Dashboard, Agile, Scrum Calls, and Jira Management

## Git Project Dashboard

### Git Version Control System
Git is a distributed version control system widely used for source code management in software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, providing tools for collaboration and tracking changes.

### Key Concepts
1. **Branching in Git**: Creating a separate line of development within a project. Branches are used to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment with new ideas.

2. **Merging in Git**: Combining changes from different branches. This process integrates the work done in separate branches.

3. **Conflict Resolution in Git**: Occurs when changes in different branches conflict. Git provides tools to resolve these conflicts manually.

###Git Project Management Tools
- **GitHub**: A web-based platform offering Git repositories, collaboration tools, and project management features like issues and pull requests.
- **GitLab**: A platform providing Git repository management, continuous integration, and DevOps lifecycle tools.
- **Bitbucket**: Another Git repository management tool offering features for collaboration and project management.


## Agile Methodology

### Agile Principles and Values
Agile is a set of principles and values that promote iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility. The Agile Manifesto emphasizes:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

### Agile Frameworks
- **Scrum**: Focuses on delivering value in short, iterative cycles called sprints. It includes defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team) and ceremonies (Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective).
- **Kanban**: A visual method for managing work as it moves through a process. It emphasizes continuous delivery and improvement.

### Roles in Agile Teams
- **Product Owner**: Defines product backlog, prioritizes tasks, and ensures the team delivers value.
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates Scrum ceremonies, removes impediments, and ensures the team follows Agile practices.
- **Development Team**: Cross-functional group responsible for delivering the product increments.

## Scrum Calls

### Scrum Ceremonies
- **Sprint Planning**: Held at the start of each sprint to define the sprint goal and select backlog items to be worked on.
- **Daily Standups**: Short daily meetings where team members discuss progress, plans for the day, and any impediments.
- **Sprint Review**: Held at the end of the sprint to demonstrate the completed work to stakeholders and gather feedback.
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Conducted after the Sprint Review to reflect on the past sprint, identify improvements, and plan for the next sprint.

### Participation in Scrum Calls
- **Effective Participation**: Be prepared, stay focused, and actively contribute to discussions. Respect time constraints and follow the meeting agenda.

## Jira Management

### Creating and Managing Jira Issues
- **Creating Issues**: Define new tasks, bugs, or features in Jira. Provide clear descriptions, priority, and assign to appropriate team members.
- **Tracking and Prioritizing**: Use Jira’s backlog and boards to track progress and prioritize work based on business value and urgency.


### Jira Reporting and Dashboards
- **Reports**: Utilize Jira’s reporting tools to monitor team performance, sprint progress, and project status.
- **Dashboards**: Customize dashboards to display key metrics and visualizations that help manage and track project activities.
